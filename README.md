# Hack Search

Hack Search is a tech-community-oriented distributed vertical search engine.

We started this project with our own experience. When we were programming newbies, we once had difficult time looking for useful resources, since there is too much irrelevant information on current search engines such as Google and Baidu. However, as we learned more about programming, we found that technological blogs were resources that helped us a lot. That's why we choose to implement an tech-specific search engine for programming beginners.
