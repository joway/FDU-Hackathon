# Hack Search

Hack Search is a tech-community-oriented distributed vertical search engine.

On a contemporary society, various technological article authors build their own technological blogs to share some summary and notes with the society. On the other hand, for searchers, it is hard to find technological contents with certain keywords. Even with Google, good and bad contents might be jumbled together. Therefore, a vertical search engine, i.e., a domain-specified search engine is required for technlogical communities.
